# Routing

You can use any client side router with Presto - it is not tied to any particular implementation. It provides some
general utilities to assist with routing (both client or server side).

-   [UrlPattern](doc:UrlPattern) provides a standard way to define URL patterns with functions to resolve any arguments
    or append query string parameters.
-   [NamedUrlPatterns](doc:NamedUrlPatterns) lets you specify a name for a `UrlPattern` and use that throughout your site
    rather than hardcoding a URL.
-   [useUrlQueryState](doc:useUrlQueryState) makes dealing with state stored in URL query parameters as convenient as the
    `useState` hook.
